# Coding Examples

Purpose: I have written the following files in this repo for any prospective employers interested in having some coding examples to look at. The idea is to have some straight-forward smaller-scale exercises so that they are easy for people to review. I will be adding additional files over time.  

### Files  

'Coding Example - ML Models.r'  
Uses the `iris` built-in dataset in R to run a few machine learning predictive models of Species based on other plant features using a few different machine learning models. Also demonstrates use of cross-validation and ggplot2 graphical display.  

'Coding Example - ML in Python.ipynb/.py/.html'   
Similar to the above example but worked through instead using Python with just a random forest model. Alternate file formats are provided for ease-of-use options: python script, jupyter notebook, or html output.  

'Coding Example - Linear Reg, Lasso, Pipelines.ipynb'  
Example of linear regression in Python using Boston housing data. Using lasso and ridge regression and the construction of a pipeline to automate standardization, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection between the candidate models.

'Coding Example - Database, SQL.r'  
Uses the 'iris' built-in dataset in R to build a complementary dataset and these two datasets are used to build a database use the RSQLite backend. The database is then queries using a few examples to showcase some inner join and aggregating functions using both dplyr and SQL code syntax to achieve the same results.  

'Coding Example - LR and GLR.r'   
Uses built-in R datasets to do general and generalized linear regression examples. Does one stepwise variable selection but is generally not focused on model selection or diagnostics more than just showing basic modeling code and generating some inferential statistics.

'Coding Example - PCA.r'  
Uses a high dimensional dataset from the UCI machine learning repository database to showcase a technique in dimensional reduction, principal component analysis (PCA). The dimensionally reduced data is then used to for some light modeling using random forest modeling. The root mean squared error and r-squared values for the resulting model are given.
