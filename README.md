Purpose: I have written the following files in this repo for any prospective employers interested in having some coding examples to look at. The idea is to have some straight-forward smaller-scale exercises so that they are easy for people to review. I will be adding additional files over time.  

### Files  

'Coding Example - ML Models.r'  
Uses the `iris` built-in dataset in R to run a few machine learning predictive models of Species based on other plant features using a few different machine learning models. Also demonstrates use of cross-validation and ggplot2 graphical display.  

'Coding Example - Database, SQL.r'  
Uses the 'iris' built-in dataset in R to build a complementary dataset and these two datasets are used to build a database use the RSQLite backend. The database is then queries using a few examples to showcase some inner join and aggregating functions using both dplyr and SQL code syntax to achieve the same results.
